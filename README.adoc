This guide walks you through the process of publishing and subscribing to messages using a JMS broker.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application that uses Spring's `JmsTemplate` to post a single message and subscribes
to it with a POJO annotated with `@JmsListener`.

== Create a message receiver
Spring provides the means to publish messages to any POJO. As from Spring 4.1, any method
of a Spring-managed bean can be annotated with `@JmsListener` to create a message container
automatically.

`src/main/java/hello/Receiver.java`

This is also known as a **message driven POJO**. As you can see in the code above, there
is no need to implement any particular interface or for the method to have any particular
name. The `@JmsListener` annotation specifies the destination and that the message should
be received in a publish/subscribe fashion.

== Send and receive JMS messages with Spring
Next, wire up a sender and a receiver.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`

`@EnableJms` enables detection of `@JmsListener` annotations on any Spring-managed bean
in the container. To create the message listener container responsible to serve incoming
messages asynchronously, we need to provide a `JmsListenerContainerFactory` that is
configured with the `connectionFactory` to use.

Each `@JmsListener` annotated element requires to define the `JmsListenerContainerFactory`
to use. It is also possible to omit that attribute (as in our receiver) by specifying the
_default_ container factory to use. We do that by implementing `JmsListenerConfigurer`
and specifying the default in the `configureJmsListeners` implementation method.

Spring provides a convenient template class called `JmsTemplate`. `JmsTemplate` makes it
very simple to send messages to a JMS message queue. In the `main` runner method, after
starting things up, you create a `MessageCreator` and use it from `jmsTemplate` to send
a message.

Two beans that you don't see defined are `JmsTemplate` and `ActiveMQConnectionFactory`.
These are created automatically by Spring Boot. In this case, the ActiveMQ broker runs
embedded.

NOTE: Spring's `JmsTemplate` can receive messages directly through its `receive` method,
but that only works synchronously, meaning it will block. That's why Spring recommends
that you use a listener container such as `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` with a
cache-based connection factory, so you can consume messages asynchronously and with
maximum connection efficiency.

When it runs, buried amidst all the logging, you should see these messages:

....
Sending a new message.
Received <ping!>
....

== Summary
Congratulations! You've just developed a publisher and consumer of JMS-based messages.
